        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine: you have exactly 15 minutes remaining before you die of
            starvation. Luckily, today is not your day. You whip up this quick
            and tasty recipe, and are able to sate your hunger before you
            succumb to malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dish can go with just about any type of pasta. The recipe uses
            spaghetti, but I like farfalle.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 oz (1 can) tuna, drained (I prefer tuna packed in oil)</li>
            <li>4 oz uncooked pasta (I used spaghetti)</li>
            <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>Salt &amp; pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil a salted pot of water for your pasta and cook it al dente
                according to package directions. Prep your other ingredients
                while it cooks.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the pasta is close to being ready, add the oil to a small
                pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and
                cook it for 30 s.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the tuna, lemon juice, and parsley. Let it heat
                through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is done, add some of the pasta water (a couple
                tablespoons) to the sauce and then drain the pasta and toss
                with the sauce. Season with salt &amp; pepper as needed.
                Optional: serve pasta with freshly grated parmesan cheese and
                lemon zest.
            </li>
        </ol>
