        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken has a reputation for being dry. This is not really the
            bird's fault; rather, it is a skill issue on behalf of the chef.
            Searing chicken locks in the juices, producing a tasty, moist cut
            instead of a rubbery, stringy one. Level up your chicken game with
            this dead simple recipe.

                Add chicken to the skillet, cooking for 4 min to 5 min per
